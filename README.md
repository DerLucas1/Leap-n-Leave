# Leap-n-Leave 
a Unity project of 4 students for our game development class  
NOT a finished game 

This is a german game we created last summer for our game development class.  
It is a Jump ’n’ Run game with puzzle elements and a mean narrator.  

The main selling point is the possibility to create your own levels with an in-game level editor.   

Instructions for the editor:  
Left mouse button for placing selected tile or item 
Right mouse button to delete tiles or items 

Clicking the courser symbol at the top allows you to move items or to connect buttons with doors or lasers. 
In this mode clicking on a door lets you decide if it starts open or closed.  

The camera moves by WASD and the scroll wheel zooms in and out. 
Esc opens the possibility to load, save or try a level.  

Saving a level in .\Leap'n'Leave_Data\StreamingAssets\Levels integrates it into the Campagne (Levels are played in alphabetical order).
